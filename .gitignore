## Description of problem (Bi-level Patient-to-Hospital Assignment Simulation):
The goal of this project is to assign patients to hospitals dynamically while minimizing the total time spent in the system. The total time includes:
-Travel time to the hospital
-Waiting time at the hospital
-Consultation time
-Administrative assignment time

We implement a bi-level model:

-Upper level (leader): assign patients to hospitals
-Lower level (follower): assign patients to beds within each hospital

We use metaheuristic algorithms from the mealpy library:

-GA – Genetic Algorithm
-PSO – Particle Swarm Optimization
-ABC – Artificial Bee Colony
-SA – Simulated Annealing

## Code explication:
Lines 1–13: Installation and imports
Lines 16–35: Lower-level objective (patients → beds)
Lines 38–49: Upper-level objective (patients → hospitals)
Lines 59–87: Run algorithm function:
-60–62: Fitness function ensures integer solutions and calculates the bi-level objective.
-64: Defines integer bounds for each patient (0..n_hospitals-1).
-66–71: Wraps fitness into a Problem object compatible with mealpy.
-73: Instantiates the problem.
-75–78: Runs the metaheuristic, solves the problem, and records execution time.
-80: Returns the best solution, fitness, and duration.
Lines 90–106: Dynamic simulation setup:
-90–94: Initialize parameters and growth rates.
-96–97: Prepare lists to store dynamic patient and hospital counts.
-99–103: Generate populations dynamically with random variation.
Lines 109–116: Data generation:
Generates random travel, waiting, consultation, assignment times, hospital capacities, and bed counts for each period.
