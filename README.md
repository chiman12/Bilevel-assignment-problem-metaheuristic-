# Bilevel-assignment-problem-metaheuristic-
This project addresses a bi-level patient assignment problem: first assigning patients to hospitals, then to beds within each hospital. The objective is to minimize total time while respecting hospital and bed capacities. Solved using metaheuristic algorithms: GA, PSO, SA, and ABC.
